                  The national political parties are fully under the influence
                  of corporate groups. A large number of corrupt politicians

                  parties, who were so far considered the champions of poor and

                  or their obsolete ideology and class politics can no longer go
                  with the aspirations of the new India. The small parties that

                  narrow circles of their regional and sectarian interests that
                  they also cannot promote real justice and equality. It

                  The national political parties are fully under the influence
                  of corporate groups. A large number of corrupt politicians
                  have infiltrated in them. The totalitarian leaning and
                  anti-minority bias of a mainstream party is well-known. The
                  parties, who were so far considered the champions of poor and
                  downtrodden, have either succumbed to the capitalist influence
                  or their obsolete ideology and class politics can no longer go
                  with the aspirations of the new India. The small parties that
                  could have become their alternatives are so seized in the
                  narrow circles of their regional and sectarian interests that
                  they also cannot promote real justice and equality. It
                  therefore implies that there is no political force that is
                  capable of providing universal justice and with which every
                  Indian can associate his or her hopes.
